# Data science portfolio by Abdullah Al Minhaj ali

This portfolio will briefly explain the projects undertaken for data analysis and exploration/improvement of machine learning models Most will be aimed to be related to businesses in the fintech sector. However, some projects will look at other case scenarios. You may recognize some datasets :)

## Projects 

### Predicting depression levels 


### Titanic: Who survived?


### Body mass index prediction
The dataset for this problem was downloaded from Kaggle. 
This is a classification problem, using models we made some predictions about how obese a person would be in the index from 0-5 and tried to improve upon them. We also did brief exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between labels that can contribute towards obesity.
