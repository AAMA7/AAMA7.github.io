# Data/business analysis portfolio 

This portfolio will briefly explain the projects undertaken for data analysis and exploration/improvement of machine learning models Most will be aimed to be related to businesses in the fintech sector. However, some projects will look at other case scenarios. You may recognize some datasets :)

## Projects 

### Predicting depression levels 
This project was completed in my final year of undergrad at UEL. The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle. This is a classfication problem to understand the level of depression of participants based on their answers to questions about different mental health types like schizophrenia, PTSD etc.  As well as building the models and refining upon them, exploratory data analysis was also performed.

### Body mass index prediction
The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle. 
This is a classification problem, using models we made some predictions about how obese a person would be in the index from 0-5 and tried to improve upon them. We also did brief exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between labels that can contribute towards obesity.

### Coronavirus data analysis
In this mini-project, we look at a small dataset based on global cases of covid. We attempted to prepare, explore and model the data. In the end, some conclusions were drawn about the quality of the data and the relationships within it.
